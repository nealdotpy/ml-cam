# RASPBERRY-PI MACHINE LEARNING CAMERA
Raspberry Pi Project that combines hardware and software development into a single project.

## Goals
The goal of the project is to learn how to use Machine Learning libraries as well as custom hardware to accomplish very primitive computer vision (without use of OpenCV).

## Functionality
This project will be able to compile and run for any similar hardware configuring and depdencies on python3 libraries. The functionality will include a somewhat complex user interface that utilizes various APIs including the Google Vision API in order to "see" or localize objects in a picture taken by a PiCamera.

Future functionality could/might include email / GoogleDrive support for the project. Currently, plans for this device are for a YouTube video that it would be favorable to discard data.

## Examples
PRELIMINARY.
